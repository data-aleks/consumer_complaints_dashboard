## Project Introduction
There is a need for a tool that helps our company identify and address emerging issues before they become public complaints. The goal is to make smarter, data-driven decisions about where to improve service, how to communicate with customers, and how to stay ahead of reputational and regulatory risks.

By building a Power BI dashboard using real-world data from the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database, the analytics team can uncover patterns in complaint volume, product categories, submission channels, geographic distribution, and company responsiveness—helping stakeholders visualize industry-wide friction points and anticipate potential vulnerabilities.
This project aims to strengthen customer satisfaction, enhance operational agility, and ensure our company remains proactive in addressing consumer concerns.

**This project uses real data from the Consumer Complaint Database maintained by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.**

## Dataset Information 
This is real world data sourced via [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/#get-the-data). We will be pulling this data using public API endpoint available directly in to power bi instead of csv file.
